Context:

For my ID Assignment 2, I have decided to make an online web application on helping people to track their finances. Though there are already many different variations of finance trackers out in the market already, I still want to challenge into making one myself. This way, I am able to gain some first-hand experience in making a fully functional website which will help benefit me in the future.

Now, let me explain why I want to work on a finance tracker. People spend money everyday. However, different people spend their money in different ways. Some are thrifty, while some spend their money unsparingly, and these people often do not think about how much they spend and thus when they see their expenses, their jaws drop. These days, youths are the ones highly affected by this issue. Some of these youths do not even think twice when buying expensive products. What's worse is that, these hard earned money comes from their parents. Some youths do work at part-time jobs, but still, they should learn how to control their finances. Thus, this is why, I would like to make a simple to use finance tracker, where everyone and anyone can use, aiming to help people to control their finances wisely.

Here is a list of main and extra features that I would like to implement into my web-application:

- Login feature - This way, their finance data will not be lost
- Finance tips page - This page will provide tips on how to best use their money, may include youtube links
- Different types of finance accounts - etc. Savings, Current, Investment, Cash in Hand
- Chart for money in/money out - To give a visual representation of how their money was used for each month
- Want/Need list - A list to help users list out their wants and needs to set their priorities
- Mini experiment - A mini game to test users whether they are financial smart

## Design thinking:

### **Color scheme**:

After doing some color palette research from "https://uxdesign.cc/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129", I have decided to incorporate a variations of grey and green. Grey being that it is more comforting to the eyes and that it helps reduce battery usage for users. Green is chosen as my secondary color as it is affiliated with money. 

All the colors that were used will be listed down below:
- #222222
- #FFFFFF
- #BB86FC
- #03DCA5


### **Home Page (index.html):**

For my home page, I want to give an introduction to what this web app is about and list down all the functions so that the users will know what this web app is about. To do so, I will have to use flex boxes as well as related images to explain the features. It will be a single scrolling page. There will also be a navigation bar on top to allow existing users to navigate to their account quickly without reading the same thing over again. The login/signup function will be at the navigation bar itself.
